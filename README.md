SD2IEC v1.2a Schematics in Eagle Format

I modified the design to remove all the extra headers and add next/prev/reset buttons based on tactile switches from e-switch. It also uses a connector from amp to connect to the serial port and cassette port for power. It's optional of course and you can just wire it directly to the board.
